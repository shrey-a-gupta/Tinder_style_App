# Tinder_style_App
A mini project for learning mobile app development and learning the skills.
 Users can swipe left (dislike) or swipe right (like) on images downloaded from the Unsplash API. Through this project, you will learn both the programmatic approach and Storyboard approach to build mobile applications. You will also learn to achieve modularity and reusability with your code.

Requirements :

A batch of 10 random images will be downloaded from the Unsplash API, or an external API of your choice
Users should see one random image on the screen at a time
Users should be able to swipe left or swipe right on the image
Once users finish swiping on the first batch of images, another set of 10 images should be automatically downloaded for continued swiping
Extra challenges:

Display swiping animation when users swipe left or right
Display “dislike” and “like” feedback after users swipe
Display animation when users go from one image to the next
